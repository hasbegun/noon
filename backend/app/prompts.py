Analyze the food item in the image and provide a nutritional analysis.
Return the analysis as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "food_item": (string) The name of the food identified.
- "calories": (integer) The estimated total calories.
- "ingredients": (object) A key-value map of the main nutritional components.

The "ingredients" object should contain these keys, with estimated values in grams (g) or milligrams (mg):
- "fat": (string) e.g., "15g"
- "saturated_fat": (string) e.g., "5g"
- "carbohydrates": (string) e.g., "30g"
- "sugar": (string) e.g., "10g"
- "protein": (string) e.g., "20g"
- "salt": (string) e.g., "500mg"

If a component is not present or cannot be determined, set its value to "N/A".

Example response for an image of a cheeseburger:
{
  "food_item": "Cheeseburger",
  "calories": 550,
  "ingredients": {
    "fat": "30g",
    "saturated_fat": "12g",
    "carbohydrates": "40g",
    "sugar": "8g",
    "protein": "28g",
    "salt": "1200mg"
  }
}

Provide only the JSON object in your response.

food_identification_prompt = """
You are a food recognition expert. Your task is to identify every distinct food item in this image.
For each item, provide your best estimate of its quantity in grams (g).
Return the result ONLY as a JSON array of objects, where each object has two keys: "item" and "quantity_g".

Example response for an image of a chicken salad:
[
  {"item": "grilled chicken breast", "quantity_g": 150},
  {"item": "romaine lettuce", "quantity_g": 100},
  {"item": "cherry tomatoes", "quantity_g": 50},
  {"item": "croutons", "quantity_g": 25}
]

Provide only the JSON array in your response. Do not add any explanatory text.
